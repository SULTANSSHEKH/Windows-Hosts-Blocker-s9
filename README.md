## Installation

To get started, you need to download the tool. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/SULTANSSHEKH/Windows-Hosts-Blocker-s9/releases) to find the latest version. Download the appropriate file and execute it to install the tool on your system.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using Windows Hosts Blocker to manage your Hosts file. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1. **Open the Application**: Launch the Windows Hosts Blocker from your start menu or desktop shortcut.
2. **Add Domains**: Enter the domains you wish to block in the provided field. You can add multiple domains, each on a new line.
3. **Apply Changes**: Click the "Apply" button to save your changes. The tool will modify your Hosts file accordingly.
4. **Check Status**: You can check the status of blocked domains to ensure they are functioning as intended.

## How It Works

Windows uses a Hosts file to map hostnames to IP addresses. By modifying this file, you can redirect requests for unwanted websites to a non-routable address, effectively blocking access. Here‚Äôs a simplified explanation of the process:

1. **Input Domains**: You provide a list of domains to block.
2. **Modify Hosts File**: The tool updates the Hosts file located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
3. **Redirect Requests**: Any request to the blocked domains is redirected to `127.0.0.1`, preventing access to the sites.

This method is efficient and does not require additional software or browser extensions.
